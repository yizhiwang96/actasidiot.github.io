## Welcome to Yizhi Wang's HomePage

I am Yizhi Wang (王逸之), currently a PhD candidate in the Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology (WICT), Peking University. I am supervised by Prof. [Zhouhui Lian](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/zlian/).

### Experience

* PhD Candidate in Computer Science (09/2017 - present) <br/>
School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University

* Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science (09/2013 - 06/2017) <br/>
School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University

### Research Interest
I have strong interests in designing image/graphics generation models and facilitating visual recognition tasks with them.
Specifically, my researching projects cover the following topics:
* Glyph Image Synthesis and Vector Font Generation
* Scene Text (Character) Recognition and Detection
* Font Recognition

Currently, I am focusing on the problem of automatic visual design (i.e., posters/covers) via deep generative models.
